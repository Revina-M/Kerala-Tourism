    <h1>Malappuram</h1>
    <p>Enriched by three great rivers flowing through it- the Chaliyar, the Kadalundi and the Bharathapuzha. Malappuram has a rich and eventful history. The military headquarters of the Zamorins of Kozhikode since ancient times, this district was the venue for many of the Mappila revolts [uprisings against the British East India Company in Kerala] between 1792 and 1921. Malappuram, literally a land atop hills, - has contributed much to the cultural heritage of Kerala. A famous centre for Hindu-Vedic learning and Islamic philosophy, the temples and mosques of this region are well known for their spectacular festivals. â€¢ Along with the historic monuments and diverse natural attractions, i range of cultural and ritual art forms adds to its value as a destination.</p>
